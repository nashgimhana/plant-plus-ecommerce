@CrossOrigin("http://localhost:4200")
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/checkout")
public class CheckoutController {
    private CheckoutService checkoutService;
    public CheckoutController(CheckoutService checkoutService) {
        this.checkoutService = checkoutService;
    }
    @PostMapping("/purchase")
    public PurchaseResponse placeOrder(@RequestBody Purchase purchase) {
        PurchaseResponse purchaseResponse = checkoutService.placeOrder(purchase);
        return purchaseResponse;
    }
}
Order Entity - The Order entity represents an order placed by a customer. It includes various attributes like orderTrackingNumber, totalQuantity, totalPrice, status, dateCreated, and lastUpdated. Additionally, it maintains a one-to-many relationship with OrderItem, and one-to-one relationships with Customer, Address (shipping), and Address (billing).
@Entity
@Table(name="orders")
@Getter
@Setter
public class Order {
    // Attributes and Relationships defined here...

    public void add(OrderItem item) {
        if (item != null) {
            if (orderItems == null) {
                orderItems = new HashSet<>();
            }
            orderItems.add(item);
            item.setOrder(this);
        } }}
The provided code snippets demonstrate the backend implementation of the PlantPlus web application using Spring Boot. The ProductRepository handles product data retrieval, while the CheckoutController manages purchase requests, invoking the CheckoutService.

        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Price</th>
            <th>Units in Stock</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr *ngFor="let tempProduct of products">
            <td class="align-middle">
                <img src="{{ tempProduct.imageUrl }}" height="50" />
            </td>
            <td class="align-middle">{{ tempProduct.name}}</td>
            <td class="align-middle">{{ tempProduct.unitPrice | currency:'USD'}}</td>
            <td class="align-middle">{{ tempProduct.unitsInStock}}</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
// product-list.component.ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ProductService } from 'src/app/services/product.service';
import { Product } from 'src/app/common/product';
@Component({
  selector: 'app-product-list',
  templateUrl: './product-list.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./product-list.component.css']
})
export class ProductListComponent implements OnInit {
  products: Product[] = [];
  constructor(private productService: ProductService) { }
  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.listProducts();
  }
  listProducts() {
    this.productService.getProductList().subscribe(
      (data: Product[]) => {
        this.products = data;
      } );}}
ProductService:
The ProductService handles REST API calls to the backend to retrieve product data. It communicates with the Spring Boot backend using HTTP requests, such as GET, POST, etc. In this example, the getProductList method fetches a list of products from the backend.
// product.service.ts
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Product } from '../common/product';
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class ProductService {
  private baseUrl = 'http://localhost:8080/api/products';
  constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) { }
  getProductList() {
    return this.httpClient.get<Product[]>(this.baseUrl);
  }}
In the above code, the HttpClient is injected into the service to perform HTTP requests. The getProductList method sends a GET request to the backend URL, which fetches the list of products as JSON data. The received data is then mapped to the Product[] type and returned to the ProductListComponent.
The above frontend implementation demonstrates the interaction between Angular components and services to fetch product data from the backend using REST API calls. The Angular frontend communicates with the Spring Boot backend, providing a seamless user experience and displaying product information on the PlantPlus web application.
6.3.	Integration of Okta Developer for User Authentication and Login:

// okta.config.ts
export default {
    oidc: {
        clientId: '0oaanytgo48al2QXF5d7',
        issuer: 'https://dev-25615111.okta.com/oauth2/default',
        redirectUri: 'http://localhost:4200/login/callback',
        scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email']
    }
};
In the above configuration file, the Okta client ID is provided as 0oaanytgo48al2QXF5d7, which uniquely identifies the PlantPlus application registered on the Okta Developer dashboard. The issuer points to the Okta authorization server's endpoint (https://dev-25615111.okta.com/oauth2/default) that handles authentication requests.
The redirectUri specifies the callback URL where users will be redirected after successful login. In this case, it is set to http://localhost:4200/login/callback.
The scopes array defines the permissions requested by the application during the authentication process. In this example, PlantPlus requests the user's OpenID, profile, and email information.
6.5.	Implementation:
To implement user authentication and login, the OktaAuthService is created to interact with the Okta API. The AuthGuard is used to protect specific routes, ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain parts of the application.
// auth.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { OktaAuthService } from '@okta/okta-angular';
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class AuthService {
  constructor(private oktaAuthService: OktaAuthService) { }

  async isAuthenticated(): Promise<boolean> {
    // Check if the user is authenticated with Okta
    return await this.oktaAuthService.isAuthenticated();
  }
  login() {
    // Redirect the user to the Okta login page
    this.oktaAuthService.loginRedirect('/');
  }
  logout() {
    // Sign the user out of the application and redirect to the Okta logout page
    this.oktaAuthService.logout('/');
  }
  getUserEmail(): string {
    // Get the user's email from Okta
    const userClaims = this.oktaAuthService.getUser();
    return userClaims?.email || '';
  }
}
In the AuthService, the OktaAuthService is injected to handle the authentication-related operations. The isAuthenticated method checks if the user is authenticated with Okta, allowing or denying access to protected routes.
The login method redirects the user to the Okta login page for authentication. Upon successful login, the user is redirected back to the homepage ('/').
The logout method signs the user out of the application and redirects them to the Okta logout page.
The getUserEmail method fetches the user's email from Okta's user claims.
3. Protecting Routes:
To protect specific routes, the AuthGuard is implemented.
// auth.guard.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { CanActivate, Router } from '@angular/router';
import { AuthService } from '../services/auth.service';
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private authService: AuthService, private router: Router) { }
  async canActivate(): Promise<boolean> {
    // Check if the user is authenticated
    if (await this.authService.isAuthenticated()) {
      return true;
    }
    // If not authenticated, redirect to login page
    this.router.navigate(['/login']);
    return false;
  }}
The AuthGuard is used to protect routes that require authentication. If a user attempts to access a protected route without being authenticated, they will be redirected to the login page (/login).
With the integration of Okta Developer, PlantPlus ensures secure user authentication and login, enhancing the overall security and user experience of the web application. Users can securely access their accounts and navigate through the platform, while unauthorized access to protected routes is prevented.
